# Movie Recommender 


A simple Movie Recommendation System built as part of my internship  at Elvvo Pathway Task 2.
The system recommends movies to users based on similarity of content/features.

🚀 Features

Recommends movies similar to a given movie.

Uses content-based filtering (similarity matrix).

Trained and tested in Google Colab.

Model saved as .pkl file for reuse.
