# Movie Recommender 


A simple Movie Recommendation System built as part of my internship  at Elvvo Pathway Task 2.
The system recommends movies to users based on similarity of content/features.

🚀 **Fearures**
Recommends movies similar to a given movie.
Uses content-based filtering (similarity matrix).
Trained and tested in Google Colab.
Model saved as .pkl file for reuse.
